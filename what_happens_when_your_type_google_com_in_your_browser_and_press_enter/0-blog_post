🧠 What Happens When You Type <https://www.google.com> and Hit Enter?
We use the internet constantly — but few people realize the invisible complexity behind something as simple as opening Google.

Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at the remarkable journey your request takes across the internet:

1️⃣ DNS Resolution – "Where is Google?"
The browser doesn't speak domain names — it needs an IP address.

It checks local and browser caches.

If not found, it asks a DNS resolver (like 8.8.8.8).

This resolver may ask root, TLD, and authoritative servers to find Google’s IP address.

Result: Your browser now knows where to go.

2️⃣ TCP Handshake – "Let’s Talk"
Using the IP, your browser initiates a three-way handshake with Google’s server:

SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

This process ensures a reliable connection is in place over TCP/IP.

3️⃣ Firewalls – "Who Are You?"
Both ends check the traffic:

Your device’s firewall reviews outbound requests.

Google’s firewalls assess inbound traffic, blocking anything suspicious.

4️⃣ HTTPS & SSL/TLS – "Let's Make It Secure"
Because you typed https://, your connection is encrypted:

Your browser sends a ClientHello listing supported ciphers.

Google responds with ServerHello and its TLS certificate.

Your browser validates it using a Certificate Authority.

A secure, encrypted session is established.

Now, no one can snoop on your data in transit.

5️⃣ Load Balancer – "Who Can Handle This?"
Your request reaches Google’s load balancer, which:

Routes it to the closest or least-busy server

Ensures speed, redundancy, and fault tolerance

6️⃣ Web Server – "Here’s What You Asked For"
The request lands on a web server, which:

Serves static content (like HTML or images), or

Forwards the request to an application server for more logic

7️⃣ Application Server – "Processing Your Request"
Now things get smart:

Google parses your request (maybe a search query)

Applies ranking algorithms

Pulls data as needed

8️⃣ Database – "Let’s Get the Data"
Google’s application servers query highly distributed databases:

They fetch and rank results

Organize everything for efficient display

⏎ Response & Rendering – "Here You Go!"
The data travels back:

Application server → Web server → Load balancer → Your browser

Your browser parses HTML, loads CSS, runs JavaScript

Voilà! Google’s homepage or your search results appear.

⏱ All of this? It happens in under a second.

It’s a masterclass in distributed systems, security, and performance — running every time you press "Enter."
